# Break-the-Bricks Chapter 27 - Assignment 4

Full Stack Game Development - Data Structure Fundamentals 2

"Break the Bricks" is a 2D brick-breaking game that involves breaking different types of bricks using a paddle and balls. The main objective of the game is to clear each level by breaking all the standard bricks while avoiding obstacles like unbreakable bricks.

# Features

> Bricks

1. Standard Bricks: These are the most common bricks and require several hits to break. Breaking all standard bricks is essential to complete the level.
2. Purple Bonus Bricks: These bricks are optional to break, but breaking them increases the level's completion percentage. The player can choose to prioritize breaking bonus bricks to achieve a higher completion score.
3. Unbreakable Bricks: As the name suggests, these bricks cannot be destroyed and only serve as obstacles.

> Paddle

1. The paddle can move in two directions: left (⬅️) and right (➡️).
2. Changes the color based on the state it currently is like Red, Yellow and Green.

> UI

1. Includes basic user interface elements such as a lobby and level completion screens.
2. The lobby system displays different colors based on level completion progress.
3. Pause screen with options to resume, restart, and quit the game.

# How to Play

1. Launch the game and navigate to the main menu.
2. Use the mouse to select the desired level. Initially, some levels may be locked and require completion of previous levels.
3. Control the paddle using the left (⬅️) and right (➡️) arrow keys to bounce the balls and break the bricks.
4. Aim to break all the standard bricks in each level to progress further.
5. Optionally, break the purple bonus bricks to increase your completion score.
6. Be cautious not to let the balls drop below the paddle, as they will return to the paddle once out of the play area.
7. Experiment with adjusting the ball speed to strategize and overcome challenging levels.
8. Complete all levels to achieve the highest completion percentage and become a master brick-breaker!
